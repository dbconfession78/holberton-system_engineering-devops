#  Holberton School - 0x04. Loops, conditions and parsing
Description

The focus of this project is to learn:
* how to create SSH keys
* the advantage of using #!/usr/bin/env bash over #!/bin/bash
* how to use while, until and for loops
* how to use if, else, elif and case condition statements
* how to use the cut command
* files and other comparison operators, and how to use them

## Environment
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* zsh 5.0.2 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)

## New commands / functions used:
